# HCP mapping description file
# ----------------------------
#
# This file is used to specify mappings between image sequence names (e.g.
# T1w 0.7mm N1) to the image descriptors used for sorting data in a folder
# organization expected by the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines. For more
# background information, please see help for setup_hcp commands,
# and documentation on Running HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline.
#
# This file is used by create_session_info command. The command processes session
# information files (typically session.txt) and generates a target file
# (default is session_hcp).txt). The general format for mapping specification is:
#
# <original_sequence_name> => <user_speficied_label>
#
# with one mapping per line.
#
# Within the source file, the code searches for images with matching <original_sequence_name> 
# adds them the specified <user_specfied_label>, and saves the results in the target file.
#
# Note that in the target file, all images with names that did not match any of the
# <original_sequence_name> specified, will have an empty label.
#
# BOLD files should be given a compound label after the => separator because this allows
# for flexible labeling of distinct BOLD runs based on their content:
#
# <original_sequence_name>  => bold:<user_speficied_label>
#
# Here the 'bold' part denotes that it is a bold file and the <user_speficied_label>
# allows for flexibility in naming. create_session_info will automatically number bold images in
# a sequential order, starting with 1.
#
#
# Example
# -------
#
# If you place the following lines in this file:
#
# T1w 0.7mm N1 => T1w
# BOLD 3mm     => bold:rest
#
# then the code would label all image sequences named "T1w 0.7mm N1" with "T1w". And all sequences
# named "BOLD 3mm" with bold[N]:rest Specifically, the following line in the source file
# (by default session.txt):
#
# 03: T1w 0.7mm N1
# 04: T2w 2mm N1
# 05: BOLD3mm
# 06: BOLD3mm
#
# would be changed to the following lines in the target file (session_hcp.txt):
#
# 03: T1w             :T1w 0.7mm N1
# 04:                 :T2w 2mm N1
# 05: bold1:rest      :BOLD3mm
# 06: bold2:rest      :BOLD3mm
#
# Note, that the old sequence names are perserved.
